[ ] Add support for e-mail notifications
[ ] Add config options num_init_tries (or something) that sets how many times
    sjk-backup may fail connecting to a host before giving up. This would be
    useful for automatic backing up of laptops and other machines that aren't
    online all the time.
[ ] Add documentation/howto
[ ] Add support for remote commands to be run on the host before doing the
	rsync. Would be useful for the backing up of databases, etc.
[ ] Add support for backup intervals. Each host could have a "when" directive,
	that could be "hourly", "daily", "weekly" and perhaps even "monthly". 
	sjk-backup would keep track of when a backup was last made. Then one would
	call sjk-backup hourly from crontab.
